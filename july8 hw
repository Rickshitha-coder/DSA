1.	Find the time and space complexity for the following code and explain
 
Time Complexity
•	The for loop runs from i = 0 to i < arr.length.
•	So, if the array has n elements, the loop runs n times.
•	Each iteration does a constant-time operation: total += arr[i];.
So, the time complexity is: Time Complexity= O(n) 
 Space Complexity
•	The function uses only:
o	One integer variable total
o	One integer loop counter i
So, the space complexity is: Space Complexity=O(1)
 Final Answer
•	Time Complexity: O(n)
•	Space Complexity: O(1)

2. Determine time and space complexity. 
 Time Complexity
•	There are two nested loops:
o	The outer loop runs n times.
o	For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop also runs n times.
•	So the total number of print operations is n × n = n².
Time Complexity= O(n2) 

 Space Complexity
•	There are only:
o	Loop variables i and j.
Space Complexity= O(1) 
Final Answer
•	Time Complexity: O(n2)
•	Space Complexity: O(1)

3.Recursive factorial
 
Time Complexity
•	Each call to factorial(n) makes one recursive call to factorial(n - 1).
•	This continues until n reaches 0.
•	So there are n recursive calls.
Time Complexity= O(n) 

Space Complexity
•	Because it is recursive, each call is placed on the call stack.
Space Complexity= O(n) 
Final Answer
•	Time Complexity: O(n)
•	Space Complexity: O(n)
